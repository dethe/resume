## Summary

I have been programming for the web as long as there has been a web, using AJAX-style dynamic loading since 1998, and pushing boundaries of the browsers and my own creativity at every opportunity. I've worked for large corporations and two-person startups. After resisting becoming a manager for years, I surprised myself by being good at it and enjoying it. Programming is like an infinite box of Legos you can build anything with, and I thrive on introducing others to this world and mentoring other developers. I also enjoy building communities and making connections with different groups who can support each other to build great things.

I am currently seeking a new challenge, if you have an interesting set of problems, let's talk.
